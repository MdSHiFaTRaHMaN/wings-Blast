            <p className="my-3">What began as a small buffalo-style chicken wing restaurant in Garland, Texas,
                continues to soar to great heights. Today there are more than 2,000
                restaurants open across the globe.</p>
            <p className="my-3">Wingstop quickly became a fan favorite when
                we first opened our doors in 1994. Our proprietary recipes,
                outstanding food and superior customer service created a
                demand that could only be satisfied by more locations.
                And in 1997 we began offering franchises. Today we are
                one of the fastest-growing concepts in the country,
                attracting top entrepreneurs and operators with the drive and
                passion to own their own business.</p>
            <h3 className="text-green-700 text-3xl font-semibold my-2">Over 20 Years of Flavor</h3>
            <p className="my-3">Since setting up shop in '94, we've been putting flavor first. And we're not about to stop.
                 We're all about taking our wings to another level, saucing and tossing the freshest flavors you crave along 
                 the way.</p>
            <h3 className="text-green-700 text-3xl font-semibold my-2">Our Mission: To Serve the World Flavor</h3>
            <p className="my-3">We're not in the wing business. We're in the flavor business. It's been our mission to 
                serve the world flavor since we first opened shop in '94, and we're just getting started.</p>
            <p className="my-3">1997 saw the opening of our first franchised Wingstop location, and by 2002 we 
                had served the world one billion wings. It's flavor that defines us and has made Wingstop one
                 of the fastest growing brands in the restaurant industry.</p>
